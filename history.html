                    also

                <h2>Where it all began</h2>
                <p>A man named Tim Berners-Lee and his team created a hypertext system initially called Mesh, but later
                    renamed the World Wide Web, more commonly known by its acronym WWW. HTTP was one of the four
                    fundamental
                    aspects of the World Wide Web, along with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), WWW, and a server that
                    allowed access to the document such as HTTPD (Evolution of HTTP - HTTP | MDN, n.d.) . </p>

                <h2>Evolution</h2>
                <h4>HTTP/0.9</h4>
                <p>The very first version of HTTP was called HTTP/0.9, also known as the one-line protocol. In this
                    version
                    of HTTP, requests consisted of a single line and started with the only possible method (GET)
                    followed by
                    the path to the resource, and there was no use of URLs or headers (Evolution of HTTP - HTTP | MDN,
                    n.d.).</p>
                <h4>HTTP/1.0</h4>
                <p>After this came HTML/1.0, and while it was still very limited, its usage of browsers and servers made
                    it
                    more flexible. This was also when status codes and headers were introduced, and thanks to the use of
                    headers, non-HTML files could be transmitted.</p>
                <h4>HTTP/1.1</h4>
                <p> In HTTP/1.1, the following version, connections could now be reused and cache control mechanisms and
                    content negotiation were introduced (Evolution of HTTP - HTTP | MDN, n.d.). </p>
                <h4>HTTP/2</h4>
                <p>In the early 2010s, SPDY, an experimental protocol introduced by Google increased responsiveness and
                    was
                    the start of the creation of the HTTP/2 protocol. HTTP/2 was a binary protocol, meaning it cannot be
                    read and created manually (Evolution of HTTP - HTTP | MDN, n.d.).</p>
                <p>It was also a multiplexed protocol meaning that multiple messages and data could be sent at the same
                    time
                    over a single connection. The usage of HTTP/2 peaked in January 2022 (Usage Statistics of HTTP/2 for
                    Websites, n.d.). </p>
                <h4>HTTP/3</h4>
                <p>HTTP/3, the most recent HTTP protocol, does not have a specific release date. It was officially
                    standardized by the IETF, also known as the Internet Engineering Task Force, in 2022.</p>
                <p>HTTP/3, unlike previous HTTP protocols, is built on QUIC instead of TCP/IP. QUIC is built on UDP,
                    which
                    is short for User Datagram Protocol.</p>
                <p>UDP does not require a connection to be used, which makes it so that QUIC connects faster. Because of
                    this it is more reliable, more secure, and quicker than its previous counterparts (What Is HTTP/3,
                    and
                    Should You Enable It?, 2023).
